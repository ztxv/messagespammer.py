A simple python script that spams what ever message you want.
Can literally be used basically anywhere

How it Works
  1. First install xdotool "sudo apt-get install xdotool"
  2. Asks you the message you'd like to send
  3. Asks how many times to send the message
  4. Asks how much delay between the messages (in seconds)
